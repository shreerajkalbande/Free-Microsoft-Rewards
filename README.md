So I saw my friend typing gibberish in search bar of Microsoft Bing. He told me that he is earning money via Microsoft Rewards. Microsoft Rewards requires you to type 50 searches per day.
It gets you 150 points per day. So after nearly a month, every month you would be earning 500-750 Rs. per month after reaching tier 2. So I automated the signing up and searching gibberish. Only thing left for you to do is 
to Use PythonAnywhere website to deploy this code on the cloud for running the code everyday without you having to do anything.
MAKE SURE TO PUT OUTLOOK USERNAME AND PASSWORD IN MY CODE AT LINES
